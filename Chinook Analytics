In this SQL, I am querying a digital media store database that includes multiple tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, employees, and customers. 


--1. Show only the customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

--2. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate between '2009-01-01 00:00' AND '2009-12-31 00:00'
;

--3. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.Albums a 
on a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types m
on m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.Genres g
on g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

--4. What are the total sales for 2010?
SELECT SUM(TOTAL)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate between '2010-01-01 00:00' AND '2010-12-31 00:00'
;

--5. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;


--6.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.Invoices ;
